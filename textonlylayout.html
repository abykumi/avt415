  <h1> 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design </h1>
  <h3> Summary: Jakob Nielsen's 10 general principles for interaction design. </h3>
    They are called "heuristics" because they are broad rules of thumb and not specific usability guidelines. </h2>

<h1> #1: Visibility of system status </h1>
<h3><b> The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time. </h3>
<h3> When users know the current system status, they learn the outcome of their prior interactions and determine next steps. Predictable interactions create trust in the product as well as the brand. </b></h3>

<h1> #2: Match between system and the real world </h1>
<h3><b>The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.</b></h3>
<h3> The way you should design depends very much on your specific users. Terms, concepts, icons, and images that seem perfectly clear to you and your colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users.</h3>
<h3> When a design’s controls follow real-world conventions and correspond to desired outcomes (called <u>natural mapping</u>), it’s easier for users to learn and remember how the interface works. This helps to build an experience that feels intuitive.</h3>
