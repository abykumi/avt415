  <h3> Scenario </h3>
  <p> Marie Cooper is a 30 year old woman from Seattle, Washington. Her best friend, Sam Jones, recently had surgery and is recovering well. Having had surgery before, Marie knows how painful the experience
    can be and wants to do something nice for Sam. She remembers how much Sam loves flowers and decides to order him a bouquet from Florify. She is able to choose every aspect of
    the bouquet â€” from the size of the vase to the teddy bear that comes with it! She places her order and sends it directly to Sam's house. He loves it and thanks Marie for the kind gesture. </p>
